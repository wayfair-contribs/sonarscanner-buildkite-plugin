============

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue before submitting a change.

All changes must include appropriate unit tests in order to be merged. Please ensure all unit tests pass locally (*i.e.* by running `bin/execute_tests`) before submitting a PR for review.

Pull Request Process
--------------------

1.	Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.	Update the README.md and `plugin.yml` files with details of changes to the interface. When adding configuration arguments to the README, make sure they are alphabetically sorted, contain the data type, and the default or example value.
3.	Bump the version numbers in .env and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4.	You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one other maintainer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request that the maintainer merge it for you.
